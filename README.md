"Arduino-based LiFi demo: Transmit data via light using LEDs and photodiodes. Fast, secure, and DIY-friendly. Explore the future of wireless tech!"

Lifi work through light intensity 
When the photodiode senses light it can be counted as 1 and if not it will be counted as zero
By this we can create binary code through light and photo diodes

## Overview   

This project showcases how to build a LiFi (Light Fidelity) communication system using Arduino. LiFi is a wireless communication technology that uses visible light to transmit data, providing high-speed, secure, and energy-efficient connectivity.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Utilize common Arduino components and libraries to create a LiFi transmitter and receiver.
- **Data Modulation**: Learn how to modulate and demodulate data using LEDs and photodiodes for reliable data transmission.
- **Advantages of LiFi**: Explore the benefits of LiFi, including increased security, minimal interference, and high-speed data transfer.
- **Educational**: Perfect for learning about LiFi technology, DIY enthusiasts, and those interested in wireless communication advancements. 

## Getting Started
